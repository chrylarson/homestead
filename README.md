# Chicken Coop

Open and close the door at sunrise and sunset. Use a camera to make sure all the chickens are in before closing the door.

Keep the coop at a good temperature while making sure it is well ventilated.

Make sure the chickens have water.

Make sure the chickens have food.

Make sure the door is closed to preditors at night.

# Fruit Trees

Monitor moisture and sunlight.

Alert me if I need to water trees.

# Vegetables

Monitor moisture and sunlight.

Alert me if I need to water my vegetables.

Keep track of planting times, heating degree-days, and alert when harvest time is close.

# Fence

Make sure the fence is closed, so my dog doesn't get out and eat the chickens.
